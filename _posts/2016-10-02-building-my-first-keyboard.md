title:  "Building My First Keyboard"
---
I recently bought my first keyboard PCB from [techkeys](http://techkeys.us).
It only supports six keys but you can program them to do almost anything.
This means that I could hit one key and send my password. Not terribly safe but
you get the idea.

I wanted a project that would introduce me to soldering.  This is
not exactly the hardest soldering project but a good start.  If
this project goes well, I would like to do something bigger.
I was thinking a TKL keyboard that would be hand wired.
