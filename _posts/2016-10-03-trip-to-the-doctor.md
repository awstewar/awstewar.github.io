Today I went to the hospital with my wife to have a level 2 ultrasound.
My wife is pregnant with our second child and we went for a routine
20 week examination.  It was very exciting seeing the images of our
small little girl.  The first ten minutes were magical...you really
felt like you were really connecting with the child.  Then, the doctor proceeded to take pictures and examine the child for two more hours.
I am all four making sure my child is healthy, but after the first ten
minutes the fun fades away.

After all of the pictures and measurements were taken, the doctor
came in to tell us that everything looked fine, but there could be
a lot of other stuff wrong because the ultrasound has its limitations.
He listed around 5 different huge types of defects and complications
that the test could have missed.  I just wanted to yell at him and
say: "Just tell us everything looks fine so we can be on our way".
I understand that every test as problems and errors, but we just
don't need to hear about it.  I feel like the doctor is always trying
to protect himself/herself from legal action, but please...just be human.
