I wanted to start writing down some goals so that I might actually
accomplish them.  Writing things down is usually my first step to
accomplishing them.  

- Be happier -> should be self explanatory
- Try to be less negative
- Build a keyboard
  - I have been reading the subreddit, /r/mechanicalkeyboards, and I
  wanted to build my own.  The end goal would be to hand wire a
  keyboard and hook it up to a teensy 2.0 micro-controller.  
  First, I am going to build a small 6 button keyboard.
- Get in shape.
  - This is kind of a large ambiguous goal.  I know that I want to
  have better health, but I am not sure how to get there.  I am
  going to start with a few small things.
    - Run twice a week
    - Lift weights twice a week
    - Play a sport once a week
- Learn a new programming language
  - I would like to become better at a few languages.  I need to
  focus on one and have a project to build with it.  I think that
  I am going to start with Clojure.
- Cook for myself more.
  - My wife does most of the cooking and I appreciate that.  I like
  to cook and I would like to improve that skill.  With this goal,
  I would also like to eat healthier.  Kind of a two part goal.  With
  cooking for myself, it should be fairly easy to make sure the meals
  are healthy.
- spend more time with friends
